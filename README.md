This repository is all about exercises in C# i did for a University asignature called "Teoria de los Lenguajes y Algoritmos (TLyA)".
They are entry-level at first and complexity grows within the different "Guias".
To access exercises functions go to 'Ejercicios.cs', and to execute go to 'Program.cs' and uncomment the function you are interested in.
